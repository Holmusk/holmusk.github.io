# **Value of Creating a Standardized Annotated Database**

As I was learning about ML and getting introduced to the world of Machine Learning one of the more memorable statements I heard was that “Machine Learning is, after all, data driven AI, and your model will be only as good or as bad as the data you have”. ML depends heavily on data, without data, it is impossible for an “AI” to learn. It is the most crucial aspect that makes algorithm training possible… No matter how great the AI team is or the size of the data set, if your data set is not good enough, the entire project will fail. While gathering a sizable amount of data is important, it is only the first step of the entire process, every project requires a sizable amount of time and effort to restructure the data and classify and label it. This is especially true for datasets used to present a realistic vision of our world. With the need for data so clear, there rises a need for a mechanism to store all of this data in a fashion that doesn't compromise on the  work that has already done to tailor the data to the needs of the project
